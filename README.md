## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. 
The goal is to predict the likelihood of a transaction being fraudulent or legitimate, 
thereby reducing financial losses due to fraud and improving overall transaction security.

## Objectivies:
- For flagging suspicious transactions for further review
- Reduce financial losses due to fraud
- Reduce financial losses due to fraud and enhance overall transaction security

## Content
The dataset shows credit card transactions from European cardholders in September 2013.
It consists solely of numerical input variables, which have been derived through a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transformation, reducing the original feature set into a more compact and simplified form."

## Motivation
Credit card fraud is a significant concern for financial institutions and individuals alike, 
resulting in substantial financial losses annually. Traditional rule-based systems often struggle to keep pace with the evolving nature of fraud patterns. 
This project leverages machine learning techniques to build a robust fraud detection model, 
enabling more accurate and efficient identification of fraudulent transactions.

## Problem Solving Steps:
- Data cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Preprocessing
- Logistic Regression modeling
- Model evaluation using AUC-ROC and other metrics
- Comparison with Decision Tree and Random Forest models
